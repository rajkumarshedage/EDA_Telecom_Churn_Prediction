    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Problem Overview\n",
    "To expand business on the basis of revenue-generating clients, telco businesses must both draw in new ones and prevent contract terminations (=churn). When it comes to contract termination, clients may do so for a variety of reasons, including better price offers more enticing packages, negative service interactions, or changes in their circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers in the telecom sector have access to a variety of service providers and can actively switch from one operator to another. The telecoms business has an average annual churn rate of 15 to 25 percent in this fiercely competitive market. Customer retention has now surpassed customer acquisition in importance due to the fact that it is 5â€“10 times more expensive to gain new customers than to keep existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn analytics offers useful tools for estimating client churn and defining its fundamental causes of it. The percentage of consumers that cancel a product or service within a specified time frame is the most common way to display the churn indicator (mostly months).\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Objective\n",
    "In order to minimize the customer churn rate, I will perform exploratory data analysis on customer-level data to identify the key signs of why customers are leaving the business."
